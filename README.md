# computer-arch-simulator

This directory includes my coding principles, result checking standards and of course source codes. The simulator is constructed by using xilinx software and verilog language. I don't include my references here, since actually you can easily find relating study materials online.

Reports are really detailed in implementing and principles. They are written by me one years ago, and I was not intended for putting in such a way, which makes them all explained in Chinese. I feel sorry for this. And finally I hope you can truly appreciate my work.
